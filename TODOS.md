**I. Core Chat Interaction & UX**

- [ ] **Streaming Responses:** Display the AI's response word-by-word or chunk-by-chunk as it's generated, rather than waiting for the full response. This significantly improves perceived performance.
- [ ] **Stop Generation:** A button to interrupt the AI if it's generating a long or irrelevant response.
- [ ] **Regenerate Response:** A button to ask the AI to try generating a different response to the _last_ user prompt.
- [ ] **Edit User Prompts:** Allow users to edit their previous messages and regenerate the AI's response based on the edited prompt.
- [ ] **Clear User/AI Distinction:** Visually differentiate user messages from AI responses (e.g., different background colors, alignment, icons/avatars).
- [x] **Loading Indicator:** Show a visual cue while waiting for the AI response.
- [x] **Error Handling:** Display user-friendly messages for API errors, network issues, rate limits, content filtering, etc.
- [x] **Input Area:**
  - [x] Text area that automatically resizes with input.
  - [x] Send button (and potentially Shift+Enter for newline, Enter to send).
  - [x] Clear indication when input is disabled (e.g., while AI is responding).
- [ ] **Copy Message:** A button to easily copy the content of a specific AI response (or user prompt).
- [ ] **Code Block Handling:**
  - [ ] Proper syntax highlighting for various programming languages within code blocks.
  - [ ] A dedicated "Copy Code" button for code blocks.

**II. Conversation Management**

- [x] **New Chat:** Button to easily start a fresh conversation, clearing the context.
- [x] **Chat History Sidebar:** A panel (usually on the left) listing previous conversations.
- [x] **Saving Chats:** Automatically or manually save conversations for later retrieval.
- [x] **Loading Chats:** Select and reopen a past conversation from the history.
- [ ] **Renaming Chats:** Ability to give meaningful names to conversations (manual edit or automatically generated based on the first prompt).
- [x] **Deleting Chats:** Option to remove conversations from the history.
- [ ] **Searching Chats:** Ability to search through past conversation titles or content.
- [ ] **Pinning Chats:** Option to pin important chats to the top of the history list.

**III. Content Formatting & Display**

- [x] **Markdown Support:** Render Markdown formatting in AI responses (bold, italics, lists, links, tables, etc.).
- [ ] **Timestamp Display:** Show timestamps for messages (optional).
- [ ] **Responsive Design:** Ensure the interface works well on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- [x] **Theme Options:** Light mode / Dark mode toggle.

**IV. Model Interaction & Configuration (May require backend changes)**

- [x] **Model Selection:** If your backend supports multiple models, allow users to choose which one to interact with.
- [ ] **System Prompt / Custom Instructions:** Allow users to set a persistent instruction or persona for the AI within a specific chat or globally.
- [ ] **Parameter Adjustment (Advanced):** Expose controls for things like Temperature or Top P (often hidden or for advanced users).
- [ ] **Token Count Display:** Show the number of tokens used in a prompt/response (useful for debugging or cost awareness).

**V. Advanced Features**

- [ ] **User Feedback:** Thumbs up/down buttons on AI responses to collect feedback (might require a backend to store this).
- [ ] **Sharing Chats:** Generate a unique, shareable link for a specific conversation (read-only).
- [ ] **File Upload:** Allow users to upload files (text, code, potentially images) for the AI to analyze or use as context. (Requires significant backend work).
- [ ] **Image Generation/Display:** If using models that can generate or understand images, integrate image display.
- [ ] **Voice Input/Output:** Speech-to-text for input and text-to-speech for output.
- [ ] **Plugin/Tool Integration:** Ability for the AI to use external tools (web search, code execution, calculators) â€“ complex integration.
- [ ] **User Authentication:** If intended for multiple users, implement user sign-up, login, and profile management.
- [ ] **Export Chat:** Allow users to download a conversation (e.g., as Markdown, JSON, or TXT).

**VI. Technical & Backend Considerations (Influencing Frontend)**

- [x] **Context Management:** Ensure previous turns of the conversation are correctly sent to the backend API to maintain context.
- [ ] **API Key Management:** Secure handling of API keys (yours or potentially allowing users to enter their own).
- [ ] **Rate Limiting Handling:** Gracefully handle rate limits imposed by the underlying LLM API.
- [ ] **Data Privacy & Security:** Consider how user data and conversations are stored and protected.

**Prioritization:**

Don't feel overwhelmed! You don't need all of these. Prioritize based on your goals:

1.  **Core UX:** Focus on making the basic interaction smooth (Streaming, Stop Generation, Copy, Code Blocks, Error Handling).
2.  **Conversation Management:** Being able to manage multiple chats is usually the next most important step (New/Save/Load/Rename/Delete History).
3.  **Enhancements:** Markdown, Themes, Regenerate, Edit Prompt.
4.  **Advanced:** The rest, depending on your specific vision for the app.

Good luck with the continued development!
